# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and projects with a clean and simple design. The site features two primary pages: a Home page and a Contact page.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Provides an overview of my background, skills, and a selection of featured projects. Itâ€™s designed to introduce visitors to who I am and what I do.
- **Contact Page:** Includes a contact form that allows visitors to get in touch with me directly. This page also contains my contact details and links to my social media profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure and content of the website.
- **CSS:** For styling and making the website visually appealing and responsive.
